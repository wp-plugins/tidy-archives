Tidy Archives will display your archives in a practical way. 

== Description ==

Tidy Archives will display your archives in a practical way. It displays links to monthly archives together with direct post links for the current year, while for previous years it only displays a link to the yearly archives.

The format in short:

Month Year
- list of posts in that month

followed by a list of previous years.

So the idea is to have the archives displayed like this example:

February 2011
- Post 3
- Post 2
- Post 1

January 2011
- Post 4
- Post 3
- Post 2
- Post 1

2010
2009
2008
